Write the first class Base:

Create a folder named models with an empty file **init**.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

Create a file named models/base.py:

Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):

Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
